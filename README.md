# Spam-Ham-message-detector

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based spam or ham message detector. It classifies messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a variety of machine learning models. The project is built using Python and leverages libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and spacy.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for model training.
- Feature Extraction: Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
- Model Training: Training different machine learning models to classify messages.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
- Prediction: Making predictions on new messages.
